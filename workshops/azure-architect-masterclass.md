Vishwas Lele, an eight-time Azure MVP, and Microsoft Regional Director, will conduct this workshop. Vishwas has been working with cloud technologies since 2007 and has helped dozens of commercial and private-sector companies adopt the cloud.

This Azure CSA Master Class is custom-designed to help you take your existing architecture and design skills to the realm of cloud computing. We will quickly move beyond topics like "What is an App Service?" or “How to setup highly available VM?" etc. and discuss real-world guidance, best practices, and constraints associated with using these services. Attendees of the workshop are encouraged to watch Azure Essentials ( Azure.com/Essentials )in preparation for the course, allowing us to move past the fundamentals quickly.

This course is filled with demos and code to help you develop a deep understanding of key concepts. Since we have such a wide range of topics to cover, we will not have time for hands-on labs during the regular class hours. Instead, attendees can fork the code repo created for the class and experiment independently.

The goal of this class is to engender a native cloud mindset. Cloud-native is a mindset that goes beyond moving an existing application to the cloud or leveraging the latest and excellent cloud services. Cloud-native is a solution-focused approach to building applications that maximizes the benefits that the cloud has to offer.
