Struggling with web application complexity? Looking to break-free from your legacy spaghetti nightmare? Using or considering React for your next big project? Looking for a clean and elegant way to manage the state of your application? Used react before and want to catch-up with modern idioms? If you want to learn about React and Redux - this workshop is for you!

	

LEARN HOW TO

- Write robust, elegant, testable and maintainable code
- Compose your UIs declaratively
- Think about the state of your application
- Appreciate immutability, pure functions and composability
- Use hooks to manage component state, work with React context and perform side-effects
- Make your application talk to the server and tame the complexity of asynchronous code
- Leverage modern JavaScript features and tools to super-charge your development

PROGRAMME

REACT

- The big picture
- Declarative vs. Imperative programming
- Components, Components, Components
- Understanding React elements and JSX
- Virtual DOM and reconciliation
- Props as “inputs” to your components
- Handling DOM events
- Stateful components (useState & useReducer)
- Side effects (useEffect)
- Working with forms
- State management strategies
- Inter-component communication
- Using React context (useContext)
- Other hooks (useCallback, useMemo, useRef)
- Encapsulating cross-cutting concerns and building reusable abstractions with custom hooks
- Performance - memoization and pure components
- Declarative routing using React Router
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Tooling
- Modern JavaScript features and best practices

REDUX

- Challenges of state management
- Motivation
- Unidirectional data flow
- Using Redux store to encapsulate and manage application state
- Describe state changes with reducers
- Combining reducers using divide-and-conquer approach
- Actions and action creators
- Encapsulate store usage with Provider/connect
- Perform asynchronous operations
- Using thunk middleware

AUDIENCE
If you are an experienced Web Developer and you want to learn how to design, create and maintain complex and modern rich web applications using React & Redux, this is the course for you!

PREREQUISITES
This is an introductory React/Redux course but in order for you to benefit from it, you should have some experience using JavaScript and be familiar with HTML, DOM and CSS.

Prior exposure to a JavaScript framework/library is be helpful but is not essential.
