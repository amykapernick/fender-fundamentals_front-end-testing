What if you could learn in three days how to radically improve the user experience of your apps? Not by becoming a visual designer who chooses cool colors â€“ instead, by understanding users better, and crafting interactions and experiences that will make them faster and more satisfied with the software you build.

Almost all developers can learn the basics of designing good user interactions and data visualizations. Using the techniques and processes in the workshop, you'll be on your way to designing significantly better applications than you do today. You won't become an award winning designer, but you will see lots of ways to make apps more productive, with fewer errors, to require less training, and need less technical support. In short, you will see how even basic UX design can significantly increase the value of your apps. You'll see many of the scientific principles behind good design, and learn a lightweight process for doing interaction design. You'll also experience many hands-on exercises to let you try out these techniques and processes, and learn from your own experience and the experience of other workshop attendees.

Plus, you'll have fun along the way. What other workshop will feature pink flamingos, Mr. Meeseeks, asteroids, moon-walking bears, Creepy Watson, and a developer snorting code off the screen? Come ready to participate in hands-on design exercises, alone and in groups. Come have some fun, and walk out with some tangible ways to make your users' lives better.
