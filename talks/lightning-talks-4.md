Lightning talks (approx 10-15 minutes each)



	
Pwning and breaking systems (with permission) can be a creative thrill, and it feels like you're performing a valuable service to the community. That's how I felt 15 years ago when I started as a security consultant, but strangely many people I met at customers didn't agree. Developers, architects and product owners alike viewed my arrival with disdain. But why?
	

	In this lightning talk I will share my journey from ethical hacker to agile security fanatic, and why penetration testing should be nowhere near the top of the list of activities you do when building security in.

The goal of being able to build quality in software products from the get-go is something that many organizations are trying to achieve. However, the very definition of software quality is somewhat elusive which makes it difficult to agree upon the perceived level of quality in software products. Moreover, working with legacy systems poses its own set of challenges as uncertainty of preserving overall quality in the legacy product seems to be an everyday struggle for many teams.
	

	This talk builds on a multi-perspective definition suggested by Gojko Adzic in his blogpost “Redefining Software Quality” some years ago. For each perspective a series of well-defined questions will be presented that help teams challenge its own assumptions about quality in the end-product.
	

	The talk is based on practical applications of Gojko’s definition as embraced by the teams working on a legacy enterprise software in healthcare domain.

Internet users are constantly identified and tracked across the web, for purposes such as targeted advertising, gaining personal data, or analytics. This happens without their knowledge or consent, and only relies on standard Web APIs. While disabling cookies and JavaScript would solve most of these issues, it would also break most modern websites.

	This talk will introduce browser fingerprinting, why it is a problem, how fingerprinting is performed, some misuse-cases (as well as use-cases), a few defense mechanisms and attempted solutions.

Using Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for defining goals and focusing on what matters is super useful, and can provide teams with motivation in the form of autonomy and purpose. This talk provides a process, with examples, for how to come up with great OKRs in a step-by-step manner, and links this to the agile execution afterwards.
