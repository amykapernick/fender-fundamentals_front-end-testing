This session is designed to help attendees understand deep learning, how it compares to machine learning and artificial intelligence, and how it is currently used in the field of computer vision. 

Attendees will be guided through the thatched and thorny road of machine learning models beginning with the simple perceptron all the way to convolutional neural networks (and beyond) using easy to understand examples and demonstrations using PyTorch (no one will get hurt unless dad-jokes are painful to you).
