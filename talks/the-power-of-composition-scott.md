Composition is a fundamental principle of functional programming, but how is it different from an object-oriented approach, and how do you use it in practice?

In this talk for beginners, we'll start by going over the basic concepts of functional programming, and then look at some different ways that composition can be used to build large things from small things.

After that, we'll see how composition is used in practice, beginning with a simple FizzBuzz example, and ending with a complete (object-free!) web application.
