When did we as a species decide it would be amazing to insert technology into or onto... well... ourselves? Have we really - collectively or individually - thought this through?

What has history taught us about bionic enhancements and where does the future take us? Are we really on the cusp of having superhero mechanical arms and enhanced intelligence? Or is the rise of the machines only a dystopian dream?

Lars will take us on a journey filled with robots, artificial intelligence, cyborgs, nano-technology and much more - to find out how these technologies will impact us in the not-so-distant future, and how we can get in front of them to influence that impact today.
