Are you tired of juggling with complexity every single day? Don't you wish a simple life?


Technologists tend to have a passion for complexity. But because of that, we tend to overcomplicate when we face a new challenge.

Being able to find simple solutions doesn't need to be a magic trick. In this session, we will explore the value that Simplicity can bring to your life and how you can apply it in your day-to-day.

If you live in the software world, this session is for you and you can expect to go home with some handy Simplification tools.
