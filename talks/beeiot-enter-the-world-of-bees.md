How does tech in agriculture look today and in the future? How can tech be a part of the climate solution? And how can we bridge food producer and food consumer? How can we restore our relationship with nature?

BeeIoT is a research project that aims to make beehives fully and affordably autonomous by using commodity hardware and high level cloud services. By doing so, we make beekeeping more manageable and economically viable while at the same time more natural for the bees. By increasing the interest in beekeeping, we can help unlock the potential of bees to help solve the food and climate problem globally.
