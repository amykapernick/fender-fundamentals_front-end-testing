From hands, to chisels, quills, the printing press, and now the web, a written record of our existence has been a constant throughout history. Languages, and how they are depicted, have evolved alongside the tools we use to render them. Often overlooked in design, text content is an integral part of the visual aspect of an application and CSS allows us to control and manipulate its look and feel.
