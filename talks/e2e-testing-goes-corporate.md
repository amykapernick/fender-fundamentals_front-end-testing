Cypress is a complete E2E testing tool that shines where Selenium gives you hassle. When applied in a traditional corporate environment there are some hurdles in the way, Windows Authentication being a major one.

In this talk we will discuss how to get past the hurdles, and how I wrote a Cypress plugin to streamline NTLM authentication.

Want to embrace Cypress towards your company intranet sites? Theres nothing stopping you now!

Want to stick to Selenium? Much of the ideas in this talk can be applied also in a Selenium testing scenario.
