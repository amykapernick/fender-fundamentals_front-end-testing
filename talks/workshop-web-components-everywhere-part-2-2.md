Web Components are custom HTML Elements and are part of the browser spec.

Just like regular HTML tags, they can be used on any HTML platform and be part of any build process.

Web Components allow applications to be built using a range of frameworks that are 'exported' as Web Components.

Web Components are true micro-services and micro-apps.


In this workshop, we use a step by step process to build a range of Web Components that focus on data-driven APIs enabling functionality and content to be deployed in any app or website.

We will also integrate lazy loading strategies, offline access and instant rendering into our Web Components.
