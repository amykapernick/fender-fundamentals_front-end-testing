The main goal of every safety-critical system is to prevent any dangerous accident from happening.


It has priority over availability, performance and even functionality. During this presentation I will show some techniques for ensuring safety in these systems. You will see how laws of physics are used to ensure fail-safety. How using more CPUs helps in detecting defects. Why less critical tasks may be separated to other CPUs. How safety of communication is ensured. How we can make our documentation useful and up to date. How choice of programming language affects safety. Is it possible to formally proof that code doesn't contain any runtime errors?
