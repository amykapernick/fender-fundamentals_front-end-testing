In this workshop we use a step by step process of building a Progressive Web App covering Service Workers, Native App UI, local storage using IndexedDB to provide instant and offline web pages.

We also cover form submission whilst offline and look at the use of push notifications.

By the end of the workshop, we will have built a boiler plate PWA covering all the major features of PWAs that can then be customised style-wise.
