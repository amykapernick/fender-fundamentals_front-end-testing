One of the most popular programming language on the market has just got an update, and is getting even better!


With every iteration of C# we get more and more features that are meant to make our lives as developers a lot easier.

Join me in this session to explore what's new in C# 8, as well as what we can expect in the near (and far) future of C#!

We will look at how the language has changed and why this is making us better C# developers, with less bugs in our code.

We'll talk about:
- News in C# 8
- Pattern Matching
- Nullable Reference Types and avoiding Null Reference Exceptions
- How Async & Await is Improving
- Record types
