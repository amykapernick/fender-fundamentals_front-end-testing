In this session, we will deep dive into important concepts and practices on making an environment "production ready" in Azure.

Everything from infra provisioning, deployment, and security-hardening, to monitoring, reporting, operations, and process automation with integrations to various tools (both Azure-provided and Third Party).
We will begin by introducing a semi-complex "sample application" and demonstrate each concept/practice in a practical way, "enriching the app" step by step, so at the end, we will have our application ready for production.
