The Distributed Application Runtime(Dapr) is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces a diversity of languages and developer frameworks. Dapr provides code portability, via standard open APIs that can be accessed by local http or gRPC calls and is open source and vendor neutral project.


In this workshop we will build a distributed application with Dapr where each component of the application may be written in different language/framework - Go, Python, Node and .NET Core!

This will enable you to understand Dapr's “building block” approach to enable polyglot programming including service discovery, state management, pub/sub, distributed tracing and more, giving you developer superpowers.
