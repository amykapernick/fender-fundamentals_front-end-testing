For almost 15 years we have had Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (SASS) to help us write our CSS. 

But are we really using sass to its fullest? We know about variables, and nesting properties is nice, but what else can it do for us? There is a lot that SASS can do that often goes ignored or underutilized. Furthermore, mixins, includes, and functions, can change how we architect our code. In this talk we will go over some of the more advanced features SASS provides, what their benefits are, how they affect the CSS output created, and implementation use cases.
