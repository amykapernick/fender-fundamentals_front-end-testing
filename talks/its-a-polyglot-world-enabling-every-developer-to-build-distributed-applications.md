Applications built using a microservice architecture offer compelling benefits, however building them is hard and comes at a cost of having to understanding distributed systems.

Developers should focus on business logic and instead they end up solving the same problems such as state management, resilient calls and event handling with limited portability across public clouds. The Distributed Application Runtime, Dapr (), is an open source project that gives super powers to all developers to build cloud native applications, no matter what developer framework or language they decide to use. Come and find out how Dapr makes building microservice applications a joy with a vibrant community helping you succeed as building scalable, event driven code to run on your favorite cloud.
