Liam has had the pleasure of working for four different startups over the past 20 years, all quite different from one another.

Startup 1 - working at an interactive television startup in the dot com bust in 2001, created by a major UK television channel company and a venture captial fund.

Startup 2 - forming a brand new company, self funded to provide software services to television companies, successful but very small.

Startup 3 - contracting to an MP3 download company, funded by angel investors and backed by an ex executive from a major record label.

Startup 4 - a fully VC funded startup in the Shoreditch startup scene.
