Functional data is simple, safe and productive, right! However it's also immutable, requiring recomputation when change happens. And change is everywhere....

In this talk, I'll describe how the same patterns used for functional data can be applied to "adaptive data". Based on internalised event sourcing, example applications include high performance adaptive UIs for Web, mobile and also incremental computation engines. I'll be using the F# library FSharp.Data.Adaptive, though the techniques are general.
