The two fatal crashes of the Boeing 737 MAX have sent shock waves through the aerospace community, raising serious questions about design decisions and software algorithms used in the aircraft's flight control systems.

After 346 deaths, we have all been reminded of the importance of rigorous design processes and the need to engineer systems for the realities of the end users and their environment. This talk discusses the core principles of designing complex systems for users in high-risk environments and takes a deeper look at what may have gone wrong in Boeing's process.
