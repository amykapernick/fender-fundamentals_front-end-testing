Open source software is all around you: it powers everything from your watch to your phone to your toaster to the cloud. But despite the promise of it being open, taking advantage of that openness and making your own contributions can be intimidating.

But even if you can get past the fear that someone might not act kindly towards you, or that your contributions aren't good enough; where do you start? How do you get going? What sort of weird commit juggling do you need to do get that pull request merged? Well, it really depends, but it doesn't have to be scary, and there's a lot of kind people out there more than happy to help you help them. I'd like to share how I did it and help you get started on your journey. We're all working towards better software, so why not do it together?
