At Equinor, we love open source. We leverage powerful open source libraries and programs every day, and we develop and release our own.


We do this for many reasons. It's simply the better way to develop software. It's not without its challenges though.

This talk is about the everyday challenges we face maintaining a suite of free software - libraries for seismic data, parallel matrix libraries, reservoir simulators, and data assimilation tools. It's about challenges in development, transparency, packaging, and documentation, and why open source is the smart choice.
