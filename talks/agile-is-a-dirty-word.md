Any organisation that tells you that it is "doing Agile" ISN'T doing Agile. This is something I've discovered in the last few years working as a consultant.

How do you teach Agile to a group of people who think they are already doing Agile? How do you explain to a business that thinks that "Agile doesn't work" that the reason why it isn't working is because the business has to change as well as the technology group? How do you even begin to do this when everybody you meet thinks that they've "tried this all before, it just doesn't work here!"

We've worked under these conditions and we've had success in effecting real change both at ground level and throughout the wider business. In this talk I'll share some techniques that we've successfully used.
