GitHub announced Actions last year, providing repository automation and allowing you to extend the GitHub platform by building functionality that responds to events that occur in your repository.

This year, GitHub announced CI/CD build and release capabilities for GitHub Actions for Linux, Windows and macOS. Edward Thomson will show you how to set up GitHub Actions for your CI/CD workflows, integration with GitHub Package Registry, security tooling and automating common actions in your repository.
