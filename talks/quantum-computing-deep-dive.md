You've probably heard of Quantum Computing, but it still remains a mistery?

In this deep dive session we will explain important concepts like qbits, superposition and entanglement. Theoretical knowledge about quantum physics, quantum gates and quantum algorithms will be associated with practical examples using a real quantum computer on the IBM Q Experience and simulated using Microsoft Q#.
