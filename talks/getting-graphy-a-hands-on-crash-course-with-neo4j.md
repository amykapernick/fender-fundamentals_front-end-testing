Heard about graph databases? Curious about what they are and how they work? Want to know where they're best used?

Then this is the session for you! In this 60-minute workshop we will:
- Introduce you to graph databases
- Talk about how Neo4j works under the hood
- Cover approaches for identifying graph-shaped problems
- Get our hands on our very first graph database experience where we will load and query data

We'll also cover what resources are available, and how to continue your graph journey.
