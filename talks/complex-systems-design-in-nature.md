Nature is full of highly complex systems, way more complicated than the systems we build.

In the process, life has found solutions for many of the problems that we face today:

* Architecture of large-scale systems
* Communication at a distance
* Eventual consistency
* Security
* Fault tolerance
* Multivariate testing strategies
* Adaptive algorithms for learning

I will explore how nature has solved these issues, the parallels with our systems, what we can learn from the natural world, and what we could do differently.
