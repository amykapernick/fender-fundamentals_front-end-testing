The beauty of a feature flag is simplicity - it's a conditional block of code that chooses between different execution paths at runtime.

In this talk, we will combine this simple concept with DevOps principles to perform powerful operations like separating code deployments from feature releases, canary releases, product owner-driven releases, testing in production, beta & A/B testing and even, kill switches. The demos and code samples will use open source libraries like FeatureToggle (C#) and SaaS products like Launch Darkly. Learn how to achieve control and mastery over your deployments and releases with feature flags.
