Join ASP.NET Core architect Ryan Nowak on a developer-focused tour of the microservices landscape, and what's upcoming from the .NET team.

We'll show Kubernetes from the .NET Core developer point of view with lots of demos and examples of what the platform has to offer. We'll show how .NET core technology of today and the near future helps you make this use of the cloud.
