Sometimes we need to go fast and we may find ourselves on a tight budget. In these situations it is important that we spend our time and resources right. It is still possible to be professional and apply best practices.

In this talk I will present lessons learnt from a hobby project building a system for organizing players in an MMO guild.
This will include
- using bots in free chat apps for rapid development of user interactions,
- using the chat app for OAuth authentication
- Sanity for both free headless CMS, database and automatically generated management UI
- Secure and scalable backend on secretless Kubernetes using Aks, Azure pod identity and keyvault
