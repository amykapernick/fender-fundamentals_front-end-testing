Being compassionate is one of the most important things I look for in my colleagues. And since we write code for a living, writing components that are easy to use, reuse and rewrite is what I call compassionate.

This talk will teach you how to write components that your colleagues will love! We'll look at how to design the APIs, what tooling you should use to improve your code, how to test it, and much more.
