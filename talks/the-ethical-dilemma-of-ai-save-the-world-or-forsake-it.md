Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the processing capabilities of speed, scale, and capacity far beyond that of humans. As computers become more powerful, Machine learning (ML) the “brains” behind AI become exponentially more powerful. But…


AI has already proven for years that it is saving lives. Not that it has to potential to save lives; it is already saving lives and has been for years. From cancer research to medical diagnosis to safety and security and everything in between; AI is saving lives.
Yet we have technology industry pillars like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, leaders AI, who’s revenue and consequently shareholder value is rooted in internet advertising. Companies who are using AI to track your activities on the internet to detailed granularity which produces influenceable advertising that is simply scary. And these companies have basically been doing this unimpeded for years. And then there is Microsoft, arguably the leader in AI, with revenue and shareholder value mainly based in cloud consumption who is pushing federal governments worldwide hard for AI regulation.
It is years beyond the right time to talk about the nearly boundless landscape of artificial intelligence. In many ways, AI is just as much a new frontier for ethics and risk assessment as it is for emerging technology. Join Tim Huckaby in a demo heavy keynote which will elaborate the power, the risk, the ethical dilemmas we are currently facing in AI and that we will face for many years to come.
