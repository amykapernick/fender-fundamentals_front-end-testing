Capture The Flag is a hacking competition where, through methods in ethical hacking, reverse engineering and penetration testing you get unauthorized access to a system to retrieve a flag. The flag is a string which represents assets or data in a system or file.

This workshop will be an interactive session where you get to learn and test some skills in hacking. Whether you are the CSO, developer/tester or sys admin, the practical lessons of security will be useful and, as it is a game/competition, fun.

Topics include:
- Web hacking
- Binary Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Password Cracking

If you already have experience with CTF's there are more challenging tasks to undertake.

Requires a laptop and some free software tools.
