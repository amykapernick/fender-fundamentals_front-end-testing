The cloud is a magic place. Your product teams create wonderful services; publish them for the world to see and then realize that this magic place has some very different rules.

This session will show a real-world story of how Vipps moved its traditional ops gradually to cloud-native in Azure. There will be some non-technical discussions about various Azure services.

This talk is for IT decision makers like architects, leaders but also agile coaches that can help the development teams to move to the cloud.

It is assumed that you understand the basic concept of the cloud, some technical understanding, and the wish of moving to Azure.
