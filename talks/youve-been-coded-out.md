We build technology to solve problems, to make life easier, and to create access. But what happens when technology leaves people out? Excludes communities? Creates barriers? This challenge goes beyond focus groups, design thinking, and customer experience surveys. It takes self-awareness, curiosity, and talking to people outside of your comfort zone. Building technology without understanding all of the people that the technology can/does/will impact, can have a detrimental and lasting impact. AI may help us work smarter and enhance our greater impact, but it can also mean we’re building less aware of its harm at scale.


Join Lia James for a deep dive into how to evaluate our awareness beyond our own community and let curiosity drive us to build better, more inclusive technology to ensure we’re not coding people out. Watch out, when this session is over, you may feel inclined to build relationships with strangers!
