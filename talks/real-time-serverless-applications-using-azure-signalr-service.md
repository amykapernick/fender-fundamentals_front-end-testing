Applications that use real-time updates increase the fairness and data transparency among your users, and the bi-directional interactions between connected clients and server helps reduce the bursting traffic challenges introduced by traditional web-style interactions.

In this session Nelly will demonstrate how developers can quickly build a real-time app using a Vue.js client connected to an ASP.Net Core API using Azureâ€™s SignalR Service. She will show how you can build a solution like this using serverless technology in the Azure cloud with Azure App Services, Azure Storage and Azure Functions.

Come along and see how Azure SignalR Service removes the pain of building real-time applications. There will be an interactive demonstration that everyone can participate in the implementation of which is the basis of the talk.
