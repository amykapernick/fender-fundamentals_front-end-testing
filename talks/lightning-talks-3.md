Most surgeons today use 2D tools to try to solve a 3D problem - understanding complex organ structures and planning surgeries. Come see a live on-stage demo of how the HoloLens 2 can be used to move surgery planning off the screen and into the real world.

After this talk you will have gained insight into the potential for new user experiences using the HoloLens 2.

We made a huge 2.5 meter tall cardboard cut out of our boss.
