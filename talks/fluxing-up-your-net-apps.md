Learn about the Flux design pattern and how to implement it in your C# client applications like UWP, Xamarin, and all the other platforms .NET is touching now.

We'll compare Flux and Uni-Directional data flows to the existing tools and directions development takes us in C# client apps and talk about all the pros and cons that come with both. We'll take an existing Xamarin.Forms app using MVVM and "Flux it Up" to migrate to a more 1-direction flow of data and actions.

When you leave, you'll have a solid understanding of Flux and some of its existing implementations such as Redux and be confident in implementing it yourself in C#!
