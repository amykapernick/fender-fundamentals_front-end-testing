The Modern Data Warehouse architecture is a response to the emergence of Big Data, Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics. DevOps is a key aspect of successfully operationalising a multi-source Modern Data Warehouse.

While there are many examples of how to build CI/CD pipelines for traditional applications, applying these concepts to Big Data Analytical Pipelines is a relatively new and emerging area. In this demo heavy session, we will see how to apply DevOps principles to an end-to-end Data Pipeline built on the Microsoft Azure Data Platform with technologies such as Data Factory, Databricks, Data Lake Gen2, Azure Synapse, and AzureDevOps.
