Developers and designers rarely speak the same language.

As wireframes turn into web apps, points become pixels, hues are coerced into hex values…it's no wonder a schism exists between these two essential disciplines! Fortunately, it doesn't have to be that way. In this session, we'll dive into the world of living style guides: the perfect pairing of design and code. We’ll explore how to architect your apps to make use of style guides, make design apps work for you and your design team, and reign in your varying component styles, all while providing your users a more consistent and refined experience!
