Counterfeit products have been a longstanding and growing pain for companies. In addition to impacting company revenue, they damage brand reputation and customer confidence. One of our partners was asked to build a solution for a global electronics brand that can identify counterfeit products by just taking one picture on a smartphone.


In this session we zoom into the building blocks that make this AI solution work. Weâ€™ll find out that there is much more to it than just training a convolutional neural network. We look at challenges like how to manage and monitor the AI model and how to build and improve the model in a way that fits your DevOps production chain.

Learn how we used Azure Functions, Cosmos DB and Docker to build a solid foundation. See how we used Azure Machine Learning service to train the models. And find out how we used Azure DevOps to control, build and deploy this state-of-the-art solution.

AI used to only be in the hands of data science PhDs. Now any developer can integrate this exciting technology into their next project. Join us to find out how.
