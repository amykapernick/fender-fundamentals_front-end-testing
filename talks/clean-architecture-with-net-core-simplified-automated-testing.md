All developers should be writing automated tests, are you? Automated testing is a core software development practice. Extensive resources are available on the topic, and yet many developers struggle to write the most basic tests. Sometimes getting started can be the hardest part, so let's change that now.

Systems that adhere to the principles of Clean Architecture are independent of UIs, databases, frameworks, and other external concerns. As a result, the domain and business logic, the most important parts of the system, are completely isolated from external concerns. This makes writing automated tests, a whole lot easier.

In this talk, join Jason Taylor from SSW as he uncovers a simplified approach to automated testing with Clean Architecture. You will learn about unit tests, integration tests, and subcutaneous tests, along with tools, frameworks, and most importantly, where to focus your efforts. You leave this talk fully prepared to implement your own simplified approach to automated testing with Clean Architecture.
