JavaScript is a dynamic, object orientated language with a heap of quirks and TypeScript manages to move many runtime errors to compile time. Unfortunately typing the wild west which is the JavaScript language has resulted in a massively powerful but sometimes daunting type system.


In this session Jake will take you through some of the less understood features which once you understand them, you will be able to use TypeScript more effectively.

You will leave knowing what Generics are, how control flow analysis and type narrowing works and a few other key features which will help you level up how you can use TypeScript.
